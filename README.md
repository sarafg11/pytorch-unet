# pytorch_unet

Implementation of a U-Net architecture using Pytorch
To test the net you can clone or copy this repository and then, once inside the folder, run:
```
rm output.txt;python unet.py>output.txt
```
and you will get an `output.txt` file with the specifications of the net and the predicted `output` for a random `input`.
